# Ahnentoml

Python library for an experimental geneology research format - the goal is to let the researcher author TOML files
that describe individuals, scanned images, other sources, etc, and provide a format to validate, query, and transform
them to be consumed or shared in other ways.

Project name comes from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahnentafel and TOML.
